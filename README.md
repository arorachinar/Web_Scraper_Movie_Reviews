Webscraping is a method of data mining from web sites that uses software to extract all the information available from the targeted site by simulating human behavior. Each year, more and more businesses adopt webscraping tools as part of their business intelligence and advertising initiatives.

In this project, I have Web scraped movie reviews using BeautifulSoup and Requests in Python, cleaned the data and performed exploratory data analysis.
